# Giphy-Gallery
Assignment to work with APIs and basic AJAX

This project was to learn to use APIs and some basic AJAX.  It creates a set of default buttons that will search Giphy for matching GIFs.  When a user clicks on one of the GIFs, it will animate and if they click on it again, it will stop.

The user can also add new search buttons by putting in a term in the field on the right and clicking the Add button.  The user can then click on the new button and get results based on the new query.

Additional functionality added to the base:

* Shadowed buttons that animate when clicked
* The ability to remove buttons from the list
* Converting the input text to Title Case
* Checking the input for duplication so no duplciate buttons
* Ignoring case when removing buttons
* Adding the ability to adjust the rating level for returned GIFs
* Adding the abiltiy to adjust how many items will be returned
* Putting in a random offset so the user doesn't get the same GIFs every time
